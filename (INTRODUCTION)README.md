# INTRODUCTION:
# ATLIQ SALES INSIGHTS 
## Company Background :
**Atliq** is a prominent electronics goods and hardware company specializing in supplying high-quality electrical equipment to clients across India .
With its headquarters located in Delhi, the company operates regional offices strategically positioned throughout the country to ensure seamless 
service delivery and client satisfaction.
## Sales Director: Mr. BHAVIN PATEL :
### Sales Head Introduction and the issues he has been facing:
**Mr. Bhavin Patel**, the Sales Head at Atliq, plays a pivotal role in overseeing and managing the companyâ€™s sales operations across India. As the market grows rapidly, Mr. Patel is facing significant challenges in tracking sales insights and performing detailed analysis. 
Despite having regional co-managers at each outpost across the country, the insights he receives are often communicated through verbal mediums. This method of communication occasionally results in information that is sugarcoated or slightly misrepresented, making it difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of the sales performance. 
Although sales have been decreasing, the data provided by the regional managers doesn't give Mr. Patel the complete picture. In an effort to improve visibility, he has asked his managers to provide files and data; however, the sheer volume of data is overwhelming and lacks clear, actionable insights.
To address these challenges, Mr. Patel is seeking a streamlined, understandable, and digestible sales analysis system that can provide him with accurate and meaningful insights to make informed decisions.

### Data Transformation:
For data transformation, I have utilized **Power BI** to perform Power Query transformations and data modeling. Power BI provides an intuitive platform for transforming raw data into insightful visualizations, and I have leveraged this for the sales insights analysis.
To view the transformations and the data model I have created in Power BI, you can directly visit my Power BI file, which is available on GitHub at the following link:  
[Sales Insights Power BI File](https://github.com/Aniru1105/MY_-projects/blob/PROJECT-1/Sales_Insights.pbix)
This Power BI file includes all the queries, transformations, and models that were used to extract meaningful insights from the data.
Feel free to explore the file for a more detailed understanding of the data modeling and analysis process.
