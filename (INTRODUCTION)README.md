## Sales Director: Mr. BHAVIN PATEL :
### Sales Head Introduction and the issues he has been facing:
**Mr. Bhavin Patel**, the Sales Head at Atliq, plays a pivotal role in overseeing and managing the companyâ€™s sales operations across India. As the market grows rapidly, Mr. Patel is facing significant challenges in tracking sales insights and performing detailed analysis. 
Despite having regional co-managers at each outpost across the country, the insights he receives are often communicated through verbal mediums. This method of communication occasionally results in information that is sugarcoated or slightly misrepresented, making it difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of the sales performance. 
Although sales have been decreasing, the data provided by the regional managers doesn't give Mr. Patel the complete picture. In an effort to improve visibility, he has asked his managers to provide files and data; however, the sheer volume of data is overwhelming and lacks clear, actionable insights.
To address these challenges, Mr. Patel is seeking a streamlined, understandable, and digestible sales analysis system that can provide him with accurate and meaningful insights to make informed decisions.
